# BackUp
 Simple back up Python Script
 
 The resulting script copies the contents of the "source" path (files and directories) maintaining the folder structure and renaming the files incrementally. Finally it saves in "./counter.txt" the last value o the incremental from where it will be counted. At the end of the copy, if you have it configured, a WhatssApp message will be sent.
 
 I had a lot of images and videos with names generated incretingly by the camera and I wanted to create a copy without the problem of two files having the same name.
